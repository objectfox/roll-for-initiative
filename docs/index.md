## Roll for Initiative

Roll for Initiative is a handy little Slack App that helps you randomize meeting orders.

### Usage

Send Roll for Initiative a list of party members with the handy slash command.

```
/initiative Britta, Annie, Shirley, Troy
```

Random adventurer order and tasty flavor text is then delivered into the channel!

```
From a neighboring tavern table a commotion erupts, roll for initiative!
🧚‍♂️ Annie (20), 🤖 Troy (15), 👽 Britta (13) and 💂‍♀️ Shirley (1)
```

### Privacy

Roll for Initiative doesn't store any permanent data about its use other than the tokens Slack gives it to connect and ephemeral server error logs.
