## Roll for Initiative

Roll for Initiative is a handy little Slack App that helps you randomize meeting orders.

<a href="https://roll-for-initiative-kp73hsfita-uw.a.run.app/slack/install"><img alt="Add to Slack" src="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png" srcset="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png 1x, https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack@2x.png 2x"></a>

### Usage

Send Roll for Initiative a list of party members with the handy slash command.

```
/initiative Britta, Annie, Shirley, Troy
```

Random adventurer order and tasty flavor text is then delivered into the channel, and a simplified version is sent to you for cutting and pasting into Zoom or other conferencing software!

```
From a neighboring tavern table a commotion erupts, roll for initiative!
🧚‍♂️ Annie (20), 🤖 Troy (15), 👽 Britta (13) and 💂‍♀️ Shirley (1)
```

### Privacy

Roll for Initiative doesn't store any permanent data about its use other than the tokens Slack gives it to connect and ephemeral server error logs.
